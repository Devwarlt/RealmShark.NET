# RealmShark.NET [![license-badge]][license] [![version-badge]][latest] [![size-badge]][latest] ![net-8-framework-badge]
The RealmShark library written in C# to assist .NET projects related to the RotMG.

> A library/GUI packet sniffer for Realm of the Mad God built with Java.
>
> Discord link: https://discord.gg/uDK2EhJUtv
>
> RealmShark is a Java library/program created to read network packets at the kernel level without the the ability to modify, block or send packets. The library is EULA/copyright compliant because it does not use any game code or assets.
>
> Given RealmShark reads packets directly from the network adapter it can even be used to listen on a PC that is not running the game. It is an independent program from the game and is completely extendable/customizable.
>
> Multiple instances of Realm of the Mad God are not supported using this sniffer.
> As of now the sniffer cannot filter packets from multiple instances of the game running at the same time.
> The sniffer crashes if it cannot distinguish the packets from different instances at the network layer.
> In the future, OS specific functionality will be added to support multiple instances of clients.
